# Product Context

## User Problem
The user needs a way to visualize the "health" (performance, efficiency, etc.) of different levels of an organization, from the high-level company view down to individual employees. A static list or table is insufficient for understanding the structural relationships and the distribution of health scores across the hierarchy.

## Solution
A dynamic, interactive force-directed graph that allows "drilling down" into specific business units and teams. This provides a quick visual assessment of problem areas (red nodes) and successful areas (green nodes).

## User Experience Goals
1.  **Intuitive Navigation**: Click to expand/collapse is a natural way to explore trees.
2.  **Immediate Feedback**: Color coding provides instant status recognition.
3.  **Depth of Information**: While the graph shows the big picture, the overlay provides specific quantitative and qualitative data (roles, descriptions).
4.  **Aesthetic**: A dark-themed, modern "dashboard" look suitable for a demo presentation.
