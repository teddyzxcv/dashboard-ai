# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM node:20-alpine as builder

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files first to leverage Docker cache
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies
# npm ci is faster and more reliable for builds than npm install
RUN npm ci

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve the application with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Remove default nginx static assets
RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*

# Copy built assets from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy custom nginx configuration
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
